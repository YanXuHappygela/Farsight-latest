  <h1>Phase One Help</h1>
  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Vector Magnitude</b>: When an interpolated vector in the sub-voxel
      position has magnitude below this value, we take it as a critical point.
      Typical values range between 0.04 and 0.15.</li>
    <li><b>Morph Strength</b>: In graph morphological method with iteration
      of graph erosion and dilation steps, We set the morphology strength as the
      number of iterations for graph erosion and dilation.  Use higher values to
      remove longer branches.  Typical values range between 30 and 70.</li>
    <li><b>Edge Range</b>: If the distance between 2 points is above this 
      distance, we assume there is no edge between them in the graph structure
      before generating the IW-MST.  Use higher values for more connected
      graphs.  Typical values range between 1 and 15.</li>
    <li><b>Weight Factor</b>: Used to emphasize the function of either model
      description or the data description (tradeoff between coverage and
      conciseness).  Use higher values for more connected graphs.  Typical
      values range between 5 and 15.</li>
    <li><b>BSpline Order</b>: It is the B-Spline order (= polynominal degree). Note that the 
           current incarnatin of the B-Spline kernal function class is incapabble of producing B-spline of degree >3, 
           thus the possible choise is 0,1 2, 3. The default degree is 3.</li>
    <li><b>Number of Levels</b>:If the multilevel approach is used to specifying the number of levels to
           be greater than one, the number of control points that is specified by the user is the number of control points 
           at the coarsest level of the of the multilevel scheme. The number of control points used at each subsequent level
            is such that the B-Spline grid size doubke in resolution over the previous level. Hence, the number of levels is 
            the parameter to adjust the control points. Use lower values to get more smooth backbone. Typical values 
            range between 4 and 8.  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Integratedskel</b>: Extract the ridges and valleys from a 3D vector
      field</li>
    <li><b>BackboneExtract</b>: Extract dendrite backbone from a list of 3D
      points.</li>
    <li><b>SpineExtraction</b>: Generate graph structure from a list of 3D
      points.</li>
    <li><b>BSplineFitting</b>: Fit backbones to B-splines.</li>
    <li><b>RefiningSkeleton</b>: Form streamlines from saddle points and seed
      points.</li>
  </ul>
