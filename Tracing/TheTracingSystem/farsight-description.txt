The FARSIGHT Toolkit is not a single tightly integrated software package with a
graphical user interface. Instead, it is an organized collection of software
modules for image data handling, pre-processing, segmentation, inspection &
editing, post-processing, and secondary analysis. These modules can be scripted
to accomplish a variety of automated image analysis tasks.
