  <h1>Phase Two Help</h1>
  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Morph Strength</b>: In graph morphological method with iteration
      of graph erosion and dilation steps, We set the morphology strength as the
      number of iterations for graph erosion and dilation.  Use higher values to
      remove longer branches.  Typical values range between 30 and 70.</li>
    <li><b>Edge Range</b>: If the distance between 2 points is above this 
      distance, we assume there is no edge between them in the graph structure
      before generating the IW-MST.  Use larger values for more connected
      graphs.  Typical values range between 1 and 15.</li>
    <li><b>Graph Prune Size</b>: Prune the tree structure when the trivial
      branches are shorter than this length.  Use larger values to remove
      longer branches.  Typical values range between 1 and 10.</li> 
    <li><b>Weight Factor</b>: Used to emphasize the function of either model
      description or the data description (tradeoff between coverage and
      conciseness).  Use higher values for more connected graphs.  Typical
      values range between 5 and 15.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>BackboneExtract</b>: Extract dendrite backbone from a list of 3D
      points.</li>
    <li><b>RefiningSkeleton</b>: Form streamlines from saddle points and seed
      points</li>
    <li><b>SpineExtraction</b>: Generate graph structure from a list of 3D
      points.</li>
    <li><b>Delete Intermediary Files</b>: This button will remove the
      intermediary files generated during skeletonization.  Your final results
      will be unaffected.</li>
  </ul>
