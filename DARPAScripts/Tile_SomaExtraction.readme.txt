python Tile_SomaExtraction.py <ImageFileList.txt> <SomaCentroidsFileList.txt> <SomaImageFileList.txt>

Takes in image from an image file list and generates a corresponding SomaCentroidsFileList.txt which contains the SomaCentroid files. Same thing with the SomaImages.

May need to adjust the open morph size, the minimum object size, and the number of histogram bins (5 15000 128)
