Our montaging software uses executables coded by Charlene, managed with a python script made by her and Ho.

Please refer to the wiki (http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/Registration_page) for a full description.

Basic usage:
python register_pairs_parallel.py <image dir (you should cd here as well)> <imagepairslist.txt>

This script is multithreaded and may need to adjust threads_launched (line 77) if you are running out of memory.

You'll also need to copy to the folder the other contents of this one:
mosaic_images.exe
register_pair.exe
register_joint.exe
gdbicp.exe
imagepairslist.txt

Before running, you will need to set up imagepairslist.txt, using the text currently there as a guide.  
Each line represents the overlap of two tiles.  At a minimum, each tile and its adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) need to be included.  Too sparse of a list will result in joint_transforms failing to montage the volume.

After running, you can apply the generated joint_transforms.xml to other channels so that they will receive the same alignment:

mosaic_images.exe joint_transforms.xml <first image in imagepairlist> -3d

Consult the wiki for more mosaic_images usage options.
